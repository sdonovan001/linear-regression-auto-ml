# Linear Regression With AutoML
AutoML, or Automated Machine Learning, automates the process of building and deploying machine learning models, making it more accessible and efficient, even for those without extensive data science experience. It handles tasks like data preparation, feature selection, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning automatically. In the videos contained in this repo, I'll show you how you can train and serve a predictive linear regression model, similar to what we did in this [repo](https://github.com/sdonovan001/ml-linear-regression/blob/main/README.md), but without writing a single line of code!

### AutoML Pipeline
The AutoML Pipeline is very similar to a standard ML Pipeline.  The big difference is with a standard ML Pipeline you have to write model training code and manually iterate on training / validating / tuning to arrive at a good predictive model, with AutoML you need only answer a few prompts on the GCP console... and wait for the system to do all of the leg work for you.
